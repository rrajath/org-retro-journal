* Overview

~org-retro-journal~ is an Emacs package designed for users who keep a daily journal using Org-mode's date tree structure. It provides an "On This Day" functionality, allowing you to seamlessly review entries from the same date (or the nearest existing date) across all previous years.

It generates a clean, read-only ephemeral buffer that aggregates past entries without modifying your original journal file, complete with navigation tools to browse through your history.

* Features

- **Smart Date Matching:** Finds entries for the exact date. If no entry exists for a specific day in a past year, it automatically locates the nearest entry within that month.
- **Date Tree Support:** specifically designed for the standard Org Datetree hierarchy (Year > Month > Day).
- **Time Travel:** Navigate forward and backward through days or jump to a specific date using the calendar.
- **Clean UI:** Results are displayed in a dedicated, read-only buffer with headlines folded to the "Contents" level for easy scanning.
- **Non-destructive:** Operates safely by copying content to a temporary buffer; your original journal data is never touched.

* Installation

** Using straight.el (Local Recipe)

If you have cloned this repository locally:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org-retro-journal
  :straight (org-retro-journal
             :type git

             :repo "/path/to/your/org-retro-journal")
  :bind
  ("C-c r" . org-retro-journal-review))
#+end_src

** Using Emacs 29+ (package-vc)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org-retro-journal
  :vc (:url "/path/to/your/org-retro-journal"
       :branch "master")
  :bind
  ("C-c r" . org-retro-journal-review))
#+end_src

** Manual Installation

* Usage

1. Open your main journal file (the one containing the datetree).
2. Run ~M-x org-retro-journal-review~ (or bind it to a key like ~C-c r~).

| ~q~         | **Quit** (close the window) |
| ~TAB~       | Standard Org folding/unfolding |

* Disclaimer

This package was developed with assistance from an LLM (Perplexity AI). While it has been tested for standard Org-mode datetree workflows, users are encouraged to review the code to ensure it meets their specific requirements.
